eZ Accelerator extension README
===============================

Main features
=============

The principle of purging the Varnish cache is modeled on the system emptying the view cache of eZ Publish.
It does not just empty the alias nodes URL but, all URLs. (layouts, views, siteaccess host/uri etc.).
The purge is asynchronous and does not slow down the publication.

- Varnish control from the eZ Administration Interface
- Multi Varnish support (in case of redundant Varnish)
- Purging Varnish cache
	- on content publication
	- via a button in the eZ Administration Interface
	- via a php script from the command line
- Varnish configuration file optimized for eZ Publish
- StaleCache support to tell Varnish not to cache a page coming from the eZ Publish StaleCache
- Template operator to call the layout "*esi*" of a node: *esi-block*
- Template operator to send a ttl to Varnish stating its lifetime: *varnish-ttl* (overloading the Varnish configuration)
- Policy system for emptying the varnish cache
- Support compatible (not kernel hack)
- Multi-lingual
	- *fr*
	- *en*

Description
-----------

eZ Accelerator is an eZ Publish connector to connect this CMS to Varnish ReverseProxy.

The main interest of eZAccelerator is in its ability to purge Varnish cache at publication of content.
The behaviour of purging the Varnish cache is modeled on the system emptying the view cache of eZ Publish.
It does not just empty the alias nodes URL but all URLs. (layouts, views, siteaccess host/uri etc.).
The dump is asynchronous and does not slow down the publication.

eZ Accelerator is also an administrative panel that allows remote control of Varnish:
 
- Launch of various commands
- Purging specific pattern (via regex)

This interface ensures a flexible use of Varnish, no need to contact the host provider to clear a particular URL when put into production.

In this extension you will also find an *esi* PageLayout and a template operator *esi-block*. Together, they allow to include ESI in your pages.
And specify the ttl of the ESI via a persistent variable named: *ttl*.

Finally eZ Accelerator provides a Varnish sample configuration file optimized for eZ Publish.

**Note**: The StaleCache is managed by eZ Accelerator if you use this configuration file, Varnish will not cache the pages delivered by the StaleCache.

**Note 2**: A template operator: *varnish-ttl* lets you define a specific *ttl* of Varnish cache.

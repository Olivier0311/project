Changes to BC and behavior in version 4.7.0
===========================================

INI setting changes
-------------------

- Revamped cluster index mechanism

  The cluster index system, used to serve images & binary files when running eZ Publish
  in cluster mode, has been revamped completely. Settings are now to be placed in
  config.php, and have slightly different names (they all start with CLUSTER_, for one).
  Documentation on how to configure the new version is available online.
  All index_cluster_* & index_image_* files are to be removed from the document root.
  Backend specific files are now located in kernel/clustering.

  Note that if using eZDB cluster, HTTP_RANGE support should be explicitely disabled by
  setting CLUSTER_ENABLE_HTTP_RANGE constant to false.

- LogDir=log/audit

  Default log dir has changed and from now will always be relative to VarDir setting.

Change of behavior
------------------

- #019024: Mixed up class attribute IDs after re-order

  Content class edit form inputs have been changed for class attributes.
  They are now indexed by attribute ID instead of raw numeric index.
  Override templates for *content/class/edit.tpl* must thus be changed in the same way.

- #019215: Audit feature should be improved for multisite installations

  From now, default log storage will be relative to VarDir setting. This is specially
  useful if you have a multisite installation, probably using two or more databases.
  This way you can have separate audit logs per website.
